#### Future Statement on Closed Source or Delayed Open Source

League Akari has always adhered to the spirit of open source and sharing, striving to provide high-quality tools for League of Legends players. However, we have recently discovered unauthorized repackaging and commercial distribution of our software in the market. Some individuals or organizations have even modified our code and redistributed it as paid services. Such actions severely undermine the legitimate rights and interests of both our team and users.

In response, the League Akari team is actively exploring various strategies, including closed source releases or delayed open-sourcing, to better protect our intellectual property and community interests. Further details will be announced in due course. Thank you for your understanding and support.
