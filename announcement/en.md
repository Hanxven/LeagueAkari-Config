### 1. Critical Notice

When setting your **Profile Background** in the client:

- If you select **Kai’Sa — “League Immortal”**, **do not** apply the decoration whose ID begins with `6b817ce1-aac3-…`.
- Doing so will cause the client to enter an endless crash loop.

![Screenshot showing the problematic decoration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LeagueAkari/LeagueAkari-Config@main/assets/20250614/cbffa9c7-0a4f-4c76-915b-9e2388f557bb.png)

---

#### Already stuck in a crash loop?

Launch the client and, during the brief startup window, immediately switch your Career Background to any other normal skin. The application should then start normally on the next launch.
